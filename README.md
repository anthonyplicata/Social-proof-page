## My process

This was a real challenge for me. I learned I can use flex and grid together to manipulate the sections in the grid layout. Figuring out how to stagger the sections as they are was harder than I thought. I built the mobile page first and that was relatively quick. The desktop page took a lot more thinking and referencing CSS.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
